The case revolves around a criminal network that was installed in the Canary Islands and consisted of political officials, bureaucrats. They would contact business owners to whom they would convince to use their influence in order to obtain the benefit they were seeking. Between both blocks appear intermediaries who facilitated the contacts and took care of hiding the money laundering trail. The Fiscal sees "at the center of the network" the PSOE MP Juan Bernardo Fuentes Curbelo, Tito Berni; the Director General of Canarian Agriculture Taishet Fuentes Gutirrez, Fuentes' nephew; and Francisco Espinosa Navas, General of the Guardia Civil when the events happened. The relevance of their public responsibilities generated a trust relationship and expectations between businessmen. How was the criminal network uncovered? The origin of the case lies in a complaint that had nothing to do with the dismantled network, but affected Marcos Antonio Navarro Tacoronte . The former director of Sports of Tenerife Council, ngel Luis Prez Pea, filed the complaint. When the mediator declared before the Police, he said that the payments were consensual and that he believed that the denunciante only wanted to conceal his affair from his wife. The complaint was closed, but access to the mediator's phone records allowed the network to be uncovered. What political connections does the organized network have? The main figure was Juan Bernardo Fuentes Curbelo, a PSOE MP. The scope of the scandal is still pending determination, as other PSOE MPs may have been involved in the affair. The key to unlocking it may be two dinners at Ramses restaurant in Madrid attended by several MPs. In intercepted conversations, the key intermediary, Marcos Antonio Navarro Tacoronte , is mentioned.
